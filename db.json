      "body": "Printers in the 1500s scrambled the words from Cicero's \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'' after mixing the words in each sentence. The familiar \"lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" text emerged when 16th-century printers adapted Cicero's original work, beginning with the phrase \"dolor sit amet consectetur.\"\n\nThey abbreviated \"dolorem\" (meaning \"pain\") to \"lorem,\" which carries no meaning in Latin. \"Ipsum\" translates to \"itself,\" and the text frequently includes phrases such as \"consectetur adipiscing elit\" and \"ut labore et dolore.\" These Latin fragments, derived from Cicero's philosophical treatise, were rearranged to create the standard dummy text that has become a fundamental tool in design and typography across generations.\n\nThe short answer is that lorem ipsum text doesn't actually \"say\" anything meaningful. It's deliberately scrambled Latin that doesn't form coherent sentences. While it comes from Cicero's \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,\" the text has been modified so extensively that it's nonsensical.\n\nWhy scrambled text? That's exactly the point. By using text that's unreadable but maintains the general pattern of regular writing — including normal word length, spacing, and punctuation — designers can focus on the visual elements of a layout without the actual content getting in the way.

      "body": "Tossing your favorite band or singer's song lyrics into a translator to generate lorem ipsum may sometimes produce offensive content. To avoid this, remove vulgar or explicit words from the original, uncensored lyrics before running them through the translator to create your word bank.\n\nUse the \"find and replace\" feature in your favorite online word-processing program to make this easier. Then, load your cleaned-up sample text into a generic random text generator and set the number of words or lines of necessary placeholder text for your layout.",
