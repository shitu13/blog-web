      "body": "The standard lorem ipsum passage has been a printer's friend for centuries. Like stock photos today, it served as a placeholder for actual content. The original text comes from Cicero's philosophical work \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,\" written in 45 BC.\n\nThe use of the lorem ipsum passage dates back to the 1500s. When printing presses required painstaking hand-setting of type, workers needed something to show clients how their pages would look. To save time, they turned to Cicero's words, creating sample books filled with preset paragraphs.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the 1960s that the passage became common when Letraset revolutionized the advertising industry with its transfer sheets. These innovative sheets allowed designers to apply pre-printed lorem ipsum text in various fonts and formats directly onto their mockups and prototypes.",

      "body": "\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",
